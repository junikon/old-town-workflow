# OSWorkflow - Tutorial

### Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce the concepts one at a time, and guide you through using it and making incremental changes to ensure that you understand the key aspects of OSWorkflow.

The tutorial assumes that you have already deployed the example application in your container of choice. The example application is a sample workflow definition deployed using the memory-backed store. This allows you to play with the workflow without having to worry about configuring a persistence store. The goal behind the example application is to illustrate the invocation of OSWorkflow. Once you are profficient and comfortable with the descriptor concepts and elements, you should be able to 'predict' the actions the UI will present to you by simply reading the workflow definition file.

This tutorial currently has 3 sections.

* [1. Your first workflow](your_first_workflow.md)
* [2. Testing your workflow](testing_your_workflow.md)
* [3. Further descriptor concepts](further_descriptor_concepts.md)
