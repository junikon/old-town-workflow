#OSWorkflow - Trigger functions

Trigger function(s) are defined in workflow definition xml file. Parent-child relationships are specified in the [http://www.opensymphony.com/osworkflow/workflow_2_7.dtd](http://www.opensymphony.com/osworkflow/workflow_2_7.dtd)

Description of the __trigger function__ can be found in [3.2 Workflow Concepts](workflow_concepts.md), and a usage suggestion in [3.4.4 Utility Functions](utility_functions.md) page. Currently there is no trigger function example included in osworkflow-2.7.0-example workflow definition example.xml file, you have to add it yourself if you want to test it with Quartz scheduler code. However, there is a testcases that uses trigger functions so feel free to use that as an example.
